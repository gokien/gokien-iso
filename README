Congrego is a set of scripts to generate filesystems using live-build and build elementary OS images.

To build an elementary OS image you'll need to:
 1) Make sure you have the dependencies installed (live-build livecd-rootfs syslinux-themes-elementary gfxboot-theme-ubuntu)
 2) Change your working directory to this folder
 3) Configure etc/congrego.conf or leave it as-is
 3) Run ./congrego.sh as root
 4) When done, your images will be in the builds folder
